<p>Here’s a quick analysis of the 13.3 Open Workout. The workout is an AMRAP in 12 minutes of</p>
<ul>
<li>150 Wall balls (WB)</li>
<li>90 Double-unders (DU)</li>
<li>30 Muscle-ups (MU)</li>
</ul>
<p>I will look at RX scores only.</p>
<p>The WOD comes with two movements that require technical skill: double-unders and muscle-ups so we’d expect these to be natural points where people stop.
For example if you cannot perform a muscle-up, but can do wall balls and double-unders sufficiently well, you will hit 240 reps (150 wall balls, 90 double unders).</p>
<p>This workout actually came with a tie-breaker: if two athletes hit 240 repetitions each, the one how did so earlier scores more points.
But scoring that first muscle-up at rep 241 will put you above all others with 240 reps! How many points will this give you on the leaderboard?
Well let’s have a look at the scored repetitions from this workout:</p>

That’s a lot of athletes hitting the 240 mark, both for female and male athletes (though the effect is more pronounced for females, as muscle-ups typically also require a lot of upper-body strength).

<p>This is how much having at least one muscle-up (and making it through the 150 WB and 90 DU) were worth in 13.3: 7253 places for females and 6093 for males (there were a lot more male athletes in this open which explains why the fractions are so far apart).</p>
